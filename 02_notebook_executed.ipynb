    "\n",
    "- time_to_merge: time taken to merge a PR in seconds, this is feature we will try to predict\n",
    "- changed_files_number: integer indicating the number of files changed, this is an available column\n",
    "- body_size: integer indicating the number of words in the body of the PR, derived from body\n",
    "- size: integer corresponding to a categorical label generated by GitHub which summarizes the size of the changes made to the code base \n",
    "- title_word_counts_vec: vector or list indicating how many times each word appeared in the title\n",
    "- created_at_day: categorical variable indicating the day of month the PR has been created, derived from created_at\n",
    "- created_at_month: categorical variable indicating the month of the year that the PR has been created, derived from created_at\n",
    "- created_at_weekday: categorical variable indicating the day of the week the PR has been created, derived from created_at\n",
    "- created_at_hour: categorical variable indicating the hour of the day the PR has been created, derived from created_at\n",
    "- commits_number: integer indicating the number of commits in the PR\n",
